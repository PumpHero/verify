# Pump Hero Client-Side Verification

You can find the basic JS magic at the top of js/ph.js. Ignore the bloat, we copy-pasted most of it from our landing site.

You can download the repo as a ZIP and just open *verify.html* in your browser to run it offline, or if you want to compile it yourself, first install dependencies by running:

>npm i

Then you can do
>gulp prod

to compile it and automatically open browsersync,
or you can do
>gulp dist

to just compile into dist/ without browsersync

# Pump Hero Client-Side Verification

You can download the repo as a ZIP and just open *verify.html* in your browser to run it offline, or if you want to compile it yourself, first install dependencies by running:

>npm i

Then you can do
>gulp prod

to compile it and automatically open browsersync,
or you can do
>gulp dist

to just compile into dist/ without browsersync

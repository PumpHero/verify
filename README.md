# Pump Hero Client-Side Verification

https://pumphero.info/verify.html

# If you just want to run the pre-compiled files, they are located in the dist/ folder. Unzip anywhere but the steam folder (wink) and run the verify.html that's inside dist/

# To compile yourself, first install dependencies by running:

## npm i

Then you can do
## gulp prod

to compile it to dist/ and it will automatically run browsersync for you.

(You'll find the JS magic at the top of js/ph.js. Ignore the bloat, it's the same build our landing site uses)
